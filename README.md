# 🎮 GamerBot - AI-Powered RPG & MMO News Aggregator

An intelligent, asynchronous Discord Bot designed to fetch, translate, and summarize the latest news about **RPG**, **MMORPG**, **Tibia**, and **Tabletop Games** directly to your server.

> **Project Status:** 🚀 **Active & Feature-Rich**
>
> *Origin Story:* This project started as a technical proficiency test for the **Kodland Python Pro** course. It has since evolved into a fully-featured product with AI capabilities (Groq/Llama 3), persistent configuration, and multi-source support.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🧠 AI-Powered Summaries:** Uses **Groq API (Llama 3)** to translate and summarize news from English to Portuguese (PT-BR) with a "gamer" persona.
- **📡 Multi-Source Aggregation:**
  - **Steam:** Fetches updates for major RPGs (Baldur's Gate 3, Cyberpunk, Witcher, etc.).
  - **TibiaData API:** Tracks news and tickers directly from Tibia.com.
  - **RSS Feeds:** Monitors tabletop RPG news (D&D, Pathfinder) via Tribality/ENWorld.
- **⚙️ Dynamic Subscription System:** Admins can configure specific channels to receive specific types of news (e.g., `#tibia-news` only gets Tibia updates).
- **💾 JSON Persistence:** Saves channel configurations and history of seen news to prevent data loss on restarts.
- **🐳 Dockerized:** Fully containerized environment ensuring consistency and easy deployment.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.10
- **Core Library:** `discord.py` (Commands & Tasks)
- **AI & LLM:** `groq` (Async Client for Llama 3)
- **Data Fetching:** `aiohttp` (Async Web), `feedparser` (RSS)
- **Architecture:** Modular Service-Based (`services/` folder pattern)
- **Infrastructure:** Docker & Docker Compose
